# TODO soon
## Just write your name in front of a task if you're working on it


- move "size" out of static JSON into client-side template
- move "view" out of static JSON into server widget code
- what is "all_widgets"?
    * dynamic list of all possible widgets (ie DB)
- dashboard.json: which widgets we want, and their options
- persistance of positions/config...
    client side or server side?
    what about multiple dashboards on the same server?
- when asking for widget data
    need to give configation, instead of using hardcoded URIs


# High level tasks

    per instance? per route?

## Modularity
